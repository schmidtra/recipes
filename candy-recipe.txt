Ingredients:
1 Cup Confectioner's Sugar
1 Tsp Vanilla
1 Tablespoon Milk
Peanut Butter


Mix Confectioner's Sugar, Vanilla, and Milk until well-blended, and you
think you will be able to roll it out without much difficulty.
Carefully roll out the mixture (use more confectioner's sugar if it is
too sticky) and spread peanut butter all over. Then roll it up, starting
with a long edge. Refrigerate until hard and then slice into pieces.
